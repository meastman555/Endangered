# Endangered
Unity project I collaborated with some friends on for a 36-hour Game Jam. I wrote all of the C# scripts within this short time-frame, as well as completing most of the in-engine programming; my code can be found in Assets/Scripts. 

If you wish to play the game, download everything within the Build (Dec 2019) folder. It will not run unless all contents within that folder are installed.
